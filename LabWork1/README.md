## HttpServer
This work contained from 4 tasks, but here you can find only two last tasks.

First two tasks were easy, that's why I decided not to post them here.

We just used `curl` in first two tasks.

For third task I wrote a `python` script which generates 100 `curl`-requests.

And in fourth task we just debugged written server in `Java` and added some new features to it.
